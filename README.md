## Description
_Asynchrony & APIs: Martian Weather_  
A goal of this exercise is to practice using all of the build tools learned so far to create an app centered around a choice of public JSON APIs which support CORS, testing all API calls with Postman first.  
* Experiment with different tools for working with asynchrony, including callbacks, promises, the Fetch API, and async functions
* Make multiple API calls in the application
* Separate out logic clearly, including keeping business logic separate from service and UI logic if necessary
* Experiment with chaining promises

## Technologies Used
* npm
* webpack
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
